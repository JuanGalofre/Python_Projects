This is a proyect based on a stabilized and ligandless protein. 
Where I can choose an atom and the program will show me all the atoms near the selected atomn, in a fixable distance.
It uses the position of the atoms (X,Y,Z) Coordinates in order to compare with other atoms within the fixated distance.
Once it founds a match, it collects the atoms and shows them to the user.
